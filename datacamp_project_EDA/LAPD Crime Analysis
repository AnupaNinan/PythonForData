Welcome to the **LAPD Crime Analysis Project**!  
This project explores crime data from Los Angeles, California — the City of Angels — and answers critical questions to help law enforcement understand patterns and allocate resources more effectively.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Project Overview

Los Angeles, known for its glitz and glamour, is also home to one of the largest police departments in the country. With a growing population and vibrant urban life, understanding crime trends is vital for public safety.

In this project, we analyze real-world LAPD crime data to:

- Identify peak crime hours.
- Determine the most crime-prone areas at night.
- Study victim demographics by age group.


## 🧪 Analysis Questions

1. **Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes?**  
   _→ Stored as `peak_crime_hour` (int)_

2. **Which area has the most crimes between 10PM and 3:59AM?**  
   _→ Stored as `peak_night_crime_location` (str)_

3. **What is the number of crimes against different age groups?**  
   _→ Stored as `victim_ages` (pandas Series) with groups:_
   - `"0-17"`
   - `"18-25"`
   - `"26-34"`
   - `"35-44"`
   - `"45-54"`
   - `"55-64"`
   - `"65+"`

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** for data visualization (optional extensions)
