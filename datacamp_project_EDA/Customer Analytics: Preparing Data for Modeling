# üß† Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

View the project here : https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/f51fa0f1-dc28-4d22-8329-1be7f6c8f247/edit

## Overview

This project is part of a data engineering and modeling initiative for **Training Data Ltd.**, a major online data science training provider. The goal is to clean and optimize a large dataset of anonymized student information to prepare it for predictive modeling‚Äîspecifically, predicting whether students are seeking new job opportunities.

Working with a subset of the company‚Äôs full dataset (`customer_train.csv`), this proof-of-concept demonstrates how to **reduce memory usage** while preserving data integrity for downstream modeling.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset contains 14 columns with anonymized information about students, including demographics, education, job experience, and job-seeking status.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `student_id` | Unique ID for each student |
| `city` | Encoded city name |
| `city_development_index` | Scaled development index for the city |
| `gender` | Gender of the student |
| `relevant_experience` | Indicates if student has relevant experience |
| `enrolled_university` | Type of university course (if any) |
| `education_level` | Highest education level attained |
| `major_discipline` | Student‚Äôs academic discipline |
| `experience` | Total years of experience |
| `company_size` | Number of employees at student‚Äôs company |
| `company_type` | Type of company employing the student |
| `last_new_job` | Time since the last job change |
| `training_hours` | Number of hours of training completed |
| `job_change` | Whether the student is seeking a job change (0/1) |

## ‚úÖ Objective

Create a new DataFrame called `ds_jobs_transformed` that:

- Stores the data in a more **memory-efficient** format
- Maintains **data fidelity** and logical ordering of categories
- Filters to include only students with:
  - **10 or more years of experience**
  - **Employment at companies with 1000+ employees**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Transformation Rules

| Condition | Transformation |
|----------|----------------|
| Columns with 2 unique values | Convert to `bool` |
| Integer columns | Convert to `int32` |
| Float columns | Convert to `float16` |
| Nominal categorical data | Convert to `category` dtype |
| Ordinal categorical data | Use `pd.CategoricalDtype(..., ordered=True)` |


## üìâ Before vs. After (Memory Usage)

Using `.info()` and `.memory_usage(deep=True)`, the new DataFrame shows a **substantial reduction in memory footprint**, making it suitable for large-scale machine learning workflows.

## üß™ Filtering for Modeling

To support targeted recruitment, the dataset is filtered for students who:
- Have **‚â• 10 years** of experience
- Work in **companies with ‚â• 1000 employees**
